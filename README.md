# Hermes
A living signal filter and cultural observatory that curates clarity from the world’s noise. Hermes tracks civilizational shifts through daily summaries, transforming global news into a ritual of awareness — minimalist, mobile, and meaning-driven.

Project Hermes
A lean, intelligent news digest that cuts through the noise.

📌 Vision
Project Hermes is a lightweight, customizable, and AI-powered tool that curates high-signal, low-noise news recaps. It aims to replace sensationalist feeds with structured, meaningful updates — delivering clarity, context, and calm in a distracted digital age.

Hermes isn't another news app — it's your personal analyst, filtering out emotional manipulation and surfacing what truly matters, from geopolitics to breakthrough science.

💡 Core Philosophy
🧠 Signal over noise — Eliminate reactive reporting (e.g., stabbings, celebrity drama) and highlight systemic, structural, or civilization-level relevance.

🛠️ Minimalist, modular, mobile-friendly — Hermes should work lean, load fast, and adapt to different formats (web, mobile, email).

🧘‍♂️ Cognitive clarity — Present stories in a neutral, emotionally grounded tone, reducing fatigue while enhancing understanding.

🧵 Narrative cohesion — Prioritize ongoing stories and slow developments over headline churn. Hermes remembers what matters.

🧱 Core Components
Component	Description
news_scraper	Pulls articles from APIs or RSS feeds (e.g., Google News, News API, etc.)
filter_engine	Filters for topic relevance using keyword rules and semantic scoring
summarizer	Uses LLMs (e.g., GPT, Gemini) to generate clean, structured summaries
digest_generator	Formats final output into HTML/Markdown (or plain text)
scheduler	Automates daily/weekly runs (e.g., via CRON, GitHub Actions, or Streamlit)
frontend_webapp	(Optional) Lightweight viewer or dashboard for manual review/interactions
storage_backend	Optional logging or archiving via flat files, SQLite, or Notion API

🧰 Tools & Stack
Function	Free/Lightweight Tools (Tier 1)	Optional Upgrades (Tier 2)
Scraping	Python + requests, feedparser, newspaper3k	News API (free/paid), Gemini search feeds
Filtering	Keyword logic + spacy, transformers	Custom BERT/GPT embeddings, LangChain
Summarizing	GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini	Fine-tuned summarization models
Scheduling	GitHub Actions, CRON, Task Scheduler	Prefect, Airflow (for scaling)
Frontend	Flask, Streamlit, or static HTML	React frontend, mobile PWA
Storage	Markdown, JSON, CSV logs	Notion API, SQLite, Supabase

🧪 Limitations
Area	Limitation	Proposed Solution
API Limits	News APIs often rate-limit or gatekeep premium content	Use multiple sources, rotate, or fall back to RSS
Model Latency	GPT/Claude calls can be slow or costly at scale	Cache summaries, prioritize high-impact stories
Sensational Filtering	Nuanced distinction between “impact” and “emotion-bait”	Use rules + LLM scoring to calibrate
Freshness	Delay between scraping and posting	Optimize fetch time, consider push-based updates
Visual Noise	News websites are full of ads/images	Use text-only parsing (e.g., newspaper3k)

🔍 Content Rules (Signal Filtering)
Filter Type	Rule Example
Location Noise	Exclude articles with local-only context (e.g., "Toronto man arrested...")
Topic Priority	Include: geopolitics, climate, tech, science, economy
Sentiment Check	Discard content with high emotional polarity unless structurally relevant
Source Whitelist	Prioritize sources like Reuters, AP, ScienceDirect, Nature, Foreign Affairs
Temporal Threads	Flag ongoing stories (e.g., election cycles, war, economic downturns)

🗂 Output Formats
HTML: Responsive digest for personal reading or newsletter

Markdown: Plain text version for version control or archiving

JSON: Structured summaries for API or integration

Notion (optional): Push directly to a daily page for reading

Audio? (stretch goal): Use TTS to generate daily audio news brief

🔄 Daily Workflow (Prototype Phase)
Morning Fetch (6:00 AM)

Pull top 50 articles across 5–10 sources

Filtering

Apply topic and quality filters

Summarization

Generate short-form summary with context tags (e.g., [Climate], [Policy], [AI])

Digest Creation

Organize into 3–5 section categories:

🌍 Global Affairs

⚙️ Tech & AI

🧬 Science & Health

📊 Economy & Policy

📚 Culture & Ideas

Publish or Archive

Output to folder or push to Notion, webapp, etc.

🚀 Expansion Roadmap
Phase	Milestone	Description
1	Lean Prototype	Run a local script that outputs clean Markdown digest from news feeds
2	Structured Output + UI	Build small frontend (e.g., Flask) to view past digests, search, filter
3	Notion/Email Push	Auto-publish summaries to Notion or email daily
4	Interactive Heatmap	Visualize story weight or attention over time (Hermes + Project Iris?)
5	Voice Mode	Read summaries aloud using TTS as audio podcast
6	Knowledge Graph Backend	Tag stories by evolving threads and structure contextually over time

📘 Naming Notes
Hermes – Messenger of the gods, psychopomp, god of communication, boundaries, and trade. Perfect for a system that travels between chaos and clarity, synthesizing messages for human understanding.

🧠 Meta Considerations
Should Hermes remember you? E.g., remember your preferred story categories?

Should it let you ask questions like: “What’s the latest on the climate lawsuit in Montana?”

Should it learn what you skip or read deeply?

Should it allow “perspective mode” — same story from Left, Center, and Right?

These are ethical, technical, and philosophical questions for later iterations.
